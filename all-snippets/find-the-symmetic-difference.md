## What is Symmetic Difference?

Symmetric difference is a concept in set theory and mathematics that describes the set of elements that are in either of two sets but not in both. In other words, given two sets A and B, the symmetric difference of A and B (△ or ⊕) contains all elements that are in A or in B, but not in both A and B simultaneously.

Let's delve into a JavaScript function that computes the symmetric difference of multiple arrays:

```javascript
function symmetricDifference(...args) {
  const result = new Set(args[0]);

  for (let i = 1; i < args.length; i++) {
    let currentSet = new Set(args[i]);
    for (const value of currentSet) {
      if (result.has(value)) {
        result.delete(value);
      } else {
        result.add(value);
      }
    }
  }
  return Array.from(result);
}
```

## Context

1. The function `symmetricDifference` accepts a variable number of arrays using the rest parameter syntax `(...arrays)`, allowing flexibility in the number of sets provided as input.

2. It initializes a `Set` named `result` with the elements of the first array `arrays[0]`. Using a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) ensures uniqueness and automatically removes any duplicates.

3. It iterates through the remaining arrays, converting each array into a `Set` and comparing its elements with those in the `result` set.

4. For each value in the current array `(currentSet)`, it checks if it exists in the result set. If it does, the value is removed from result using the `delete()` method. If not, it is added using the `addd()` method.

5. Finally, the function returns the symmetric difference as an array, converting the `Set` back using `Array.from()`.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const A = [1, 2, 3];
const B = [2, 4, 5, 1];
const C = [2, 3, 6];

console.log(symmetricDifference(A, B)); //Output: [ 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(symmetricDifference(A, B, C)); //Output: [ 4, 5, 2, 6 ]
```

## Conclusion

With this JavaScript function, you can easily find the differences between sets. It helps you understand how sets relate to each other and solve problems quickly.
